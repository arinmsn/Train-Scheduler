# Train Scheduler
```
The information about each train that user enters into the
form each time is saved. That information includes: train name,
destination, frequency (in mins.) that train arrives, and 
next arrival time. The app will calculate the next arrival time.
In addition, once user arrives, app will re-load every minute.
